#### NAVIGATING TO THE THA LAB INSTRUCTIONS FOLDER

All THA labs contain a local copy of the lab instructions. These instructions are downloaded when you run the git clone command during the lab setup. 

Begin at a new terminal window.

1. Use the LS command to list the subfolders at your current location.
2. Using the commands shown in the module video, navigate to the assets folder at /THA/setup/assets. The correct commands are shown following the lab exercises and in lab-solutions.md

This concludes the lab exercise, continue to exercise 2
